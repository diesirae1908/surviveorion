# Orion work journal

Newest first. Every substantive change gets a dated entry here (what changed,
why, commit hash, follow-ups), committed together with the work. See
`AGENTS.md` → "Recording your work".

## 2026-07-21 — /admin day math moved from UTC to Pacific Time (this commit)

- The admin dashboard's per-day charts (visits/day, runs/day) bucketed on UTC
  days, so from 5 PM PT onward the charts rolled over to "tomorrow"; the
  "today" tiles were rolling 24-hour windows, not calendar days. Both now use
  America/Vancouver days: new `ptOffsetMs()` / `ptMidnightEpoch()` helpers in
  `server/db.mjs` (via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` — SQLite has no named timezones
  and the server is zero-dependency) shift epochs before `date()` and anchor
  "today" (visits/uniques today, users newToday) at PT midnight. The current
  offset is applied to the whole 14-day window — DST-edge rows can land a day
  off, acceptable for a hobby dashboard. Week counters stay rolling 7 days.
  Added a note on `/admin` that days/"today" are PT. Player-facing Daily
  Patrol rollover (`utcDate()` in `index.mjs`) deliberately untouched — that's
  gameplay, still UTC. Verified: build + sim-test green, plus a temp-DB check
  that a 6 PM PT visit no longer buckets to the next day. Dispatched by Sam.

## 2026-07-21 — PM-model docs: AGENTS.md + this journal

- Added `AGENTS.md` (repo context, deploy warning, guardrails, PM model with
  Sam) and seeded this `JOURNAL.md` from recent git history, bringing the repo
  into the convention used across Lucas's other repos. The parent-folder
  `Orion/AGENTS.md` (outside git) now just points here — this versioned copy
  is authoritative. Docs only, no code. Dispatched by Sam.

## 2026-07-21 — iOS tilt-permission fix (`a344159`, merged `01807d4`)

- Fixed the tilt-control dead end on iOS: motion permission is now requested
  only from the in-context Tilt pick (a real click), never at boot. The old
  boot-time request fired on the first "tap to enter" whenever tilt was the
  saved mode — players reflexively denied it, Safari cached the denial for the
  session, and tilt then silently fell back to the touch stick, reading as
  "tilt is broken". When tilt can't start, a toast now explains the stick
  fallback and how to un-wedge motion access.

## 2026-07-21 — Visual /admin dashboard (`2024923`, on `71caf17`)

- `71caf17` added traffic analytics to `/admin` (cookie-less visit beacon →
  `visits` table) and unlisted the `/fullgame` lobby link for the public
  launch. `2024923` made the dashboard visual: column charts for per-day
  trends, flag bars for countries, split bars for device/mode shares,
  replacing the number tables.

## 2026-07-20 — Public-launch hardening (`1314249`)

- Launch-hardened for the public Reddit push: device-locked guest accounts
  (`orion.guestSecret` in localStorage, hash in `users.guest_secret_hash`),
  server-enforced 3-attempts/day daily budget, spoof-resistant rate-limit IPs,
  Bearer-only admin auth with a rotated `ORION_ADMIN_KEY` (in `server/.env` +
  Render env vars, never committed), security headers, a visible feedback CTA,
  OG/Twitter social meta, and crash reports to `/api/feedback` with a
  `[crash]` prefix visible on `/admin`. These protections are now a guardrail
  in `AGENTS.md` — don't weaken them.

## 2026-07-16 — Daily Patrol pacing (`be54086`, `30e63ad`)

- `30e63ad`: daily free-death window — dying inside the first 15s of a Daily
  Patrol run refunds the attempt (the run never happened for the daily books).
- `be54086`: faster power drops on dailies (`PICKUPS.dailyIntervalScale` 0.7) —
  dailies have no refill floor, so they were stuck on the slowest pickup
  schedule; a flat scale on the same seeded draw keeps the shared script
  identical across pilots.

## 2026-07-15 — Daily front door + determinism + balance (`b96cdd8`…`20b30f8`)

- `b4fbcad` + `b96cdd8`: made the daily game the front door (surviveorion.com
  root is the daily-only lobby with 3 attempts/day, Training Ground, and a
  Wordle-style share card; the full arcade moved to `/fullgame`) and turned
  drone assemblies into real evolutions (lance / wheel / hunter / bomb).
- `ddd5468`: one drone size (`scaleClamp` pinned to 0.9) — small drones were
  invisible on phones.
- `bb01c9a`: Daily Patrol power drops and mines fully scripted so every pilot
  sees the identical run; sim-test determinism check now compares positions.
- `e532dba`: phone game-over layout fix + guest names shared across devices
  for passwordless callsigns.
- `20b30f8`: reworked Magnet into a one-shot grab (never wasted — stays armed
  on an empty board) and benched Afterburner (control-stealing dash too risky
  as a pickup).

## Earlier

The web rebuild started 2026-07-10 (v2 of the archived Unity prototype) and
the full design log lives in `git log` — commit messages in this repo are
deliberately why-focused and detailed. Highlights: retention loop + seeded
Daily Patrol (`171a233`, Jul 11), guest accounts + playtester-feedback round
(`213b33d`/`374b3ae`, Jul 12), Classic/Iron Rain modes + graze scoring +
swarm rebalance (`5b87aaa`…`0afb1f8`, Jul 14).
